# SUICIDES : A GLOBAL IMPERATIVE
Welcome to our Dashboard!

This document gives you some information about the project and why intend to address this unexplored space. It's a dark and (de)motivating area that presses the need to be deconstructed in order to complete the evolution of socio economic factors that shape the present World we live in.
## Why should we care?
Suicidal behaviour is in some way related to social indicators of cohesion and integration. The vast majority studies on the social correlates of the regional variation of suicide concern American data, whereas countries with social structure different from those of American nations have been neglected from this point of view. So, to ascertain the influence of social factors on suicidal behaviour in Italy, the regional distribution of suicides has been analyzed in relation to social security expenses, marriage, separation and divorce rates, crime rates, Gross Domestic Product per capita and consumers rates, occupational rates. 

At both the individual and population levels, the suicide rate has long been understood to correlate with cultural, social, political, and economic forces. Suicide is not everywhere linked with pathology but represents a culturally recognized solution to certain situations. As such, understanding suicide and attempting risk prevention requires an understanding of how suicide varies with these forces and how it relates to individual, group and contextual experiences.

## What we could do

We developed an interactive dashboard to throw some insights on the number of suicides in 101 countries across the globe and how it is affected by factors such as age, generation and Gross Domestic Product. The dashboard aims to provide a high level reasoning of aggregates that helps connects the bigger dots on the economic context. The app provides:

* Changing trends of Number of Suicides by year for each Country
* Relative Position of Countries in relation to GDP and Population 
* Changing Trends of Number of Suicides by age and Generation
* Overall measure of Suicides by Gender for all countries
