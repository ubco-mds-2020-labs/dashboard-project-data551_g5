## Implementation and New Features

The dashboard is currently under active development; the current release focuses on developing an interactive dashboard to provide insights into the number and trends of suicides in 101 countries by factors such as age, generation, GDP per capita. The first plot gives the world map with the total number of suicides for the countries. We then move on to analyse with the Economic trends with GDP. We then move to age based factors that gives us further insights. The final graph tells us Average suicides per capita based on gender for all the countries. 

##  Team Dynamics
The team did a good job of distributing the workload. We distributed the work efficiently that helped us focus on a lot of aspects. We worked on each of the plots with utmost importance ensuring we implement them with maximum interaction.
We found it challenging to understand the technicalities of economic factors that are often important when analysing suicide rates

## Current Limitations
Suicide is a complex issue and is not limited to economic issues; we need to consider several other indices such as human development (HDI). HDI is a composite index measuring average achievement in critical dimensions of human development: standard of living, long and healthy life, and knowledge. It must be noted that HDI captures only a part of human development and often fails to reflect on inequalities that might be prevalent in society. This suggests that HDI alone might not be a good measure to understand the dynamics of suicide and thus will be used in conjunction with GDP per capita to paint a better picture.

At the moment, all information is clustered on the landing page, which may be hard to navigate. In future releases, additional tabs will be added to the dashboard, which will split the plots based on factorsâ€”for instance, having a dedicated tab for economic, socio-economic, age and generation and gender-based factors. Additionally, adding simple regression methods to get trendlines and basic statistics.

## Future Releases
- Restructuring the current layout of the dashboard to add additional tabs to account for other factors mentioned above
- Allowing the user to plot trendlines and preform simple regression
- Implementing an API instead of a static dataset to get insights on the impact of the pandemic on mental health
- Pointing users to additional resources such as research papers, news articles and journals.
- In-app navigations to help users understand how to use our dashboard.
