#### PROJECT PROPOSAL

Our Role: Data Analytics Consultancy Firm for healthcare

Target audience: Mental health organisations across the world

Suicide is a very serious public health problem, claiming about 800K deaths per year. Suicide is not just a loss of one individual, it may have big impact on the families, communities, countries and other related  people left behind. And recently, since a big proportion of suicides are happening in the age group of 15-29 years is a matter of major concern especially for countries who are trying to reduce the average age of the country's population. Suicides were labeled as an irresponsible impulsive action taken by some individuals who are going through some challenges in life and find it difficult to cope with them. But in fact, based on recent studies, suicides have been related to many parameters like financial problems, isolation, abuse, conflict, breakups among many others.

The stimulus behind suicide attempts generally vary from country to country, and some of the factors might trigger certain age group towards this. If we could understand the potential reasons behind suicides it may be possible for the healthcare organisations to take  measures proactively and help reduce the frequency. In order to address this global challenge, we propose building a data visualisation App that would help healthcare organisations to visually explore the various factors contributing towards increased suicidal rates and take timely actions to mitigate that. The purpose of the App would be to provide an overview where the concerned authorities could filter and reorder the predictors as needed in order to determine the factors of interest for their concerned patients/communities and take action(s) accordingly.

With this App, regional government health organisations could look into the ongoing trends of suicides in the region and propose activities/ events. For example, if isolation has been the major cause in a certain area, then organising social events or groups (like hiking groups etc.) could help tackle that.

#### DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA

The dataset is compiled from four other datasets linked by year and country and aims to understand suicide rates for 101 countries across various socio-economic regions between 1986 to 2016. The dataset contains several variables of which Country, Year, Sex, Age, Population, the number of suicides, the proportion of suicides per 100k, Human Development Index (HDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year, GDP per capita and generation were deemed essential for the analysis. Columns country, year, sex, age and generation were considered to be categorical, with others being continuous. To form an analysis, indexes must be carefully understood to prevent any misinformation. For instance, the Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index measuring average achievement in critical dimensions of human development: standard of living, long and healthy life and knowledge. These dimensions are then normalised and aggregated using the geometric mean. It must be noted that HDI captures only a part of human development and often fails to reflect on inequalities that might be prevalent in society. This suggests that HDI alone might not be a good measure to understand the dynamics of suicide and was thus used in conjunction with GDP per capita to paint a clearer picture.


#### RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND USAGE SCENARIOS

A new team in the firm has been asked to put together some statistics on suicide rates for the past few decades to compile a report for public awareness on suicides and suicide attempts. The report aims to make suicide prevention on high priority on the global public health and also to encourage countries around the world to develop comprehensive suicide prevention strategies. Jane is a junior Data Analyst who recently graduated and loves to derive insights from information presented. She wishes to compile a detailed report based on mnay facts. She has been asked to look into the dataset- "Suicide Rates overview 1986-2016". Jane has read the [description] of the dataset and she wants to [explore] and [analyze] the dataset to get some initial sense of some insights about the data. Jane has some initial [EDA] done on the data. When Jane accesses the app "Suicides : A global imperative". The app provides a world-wide suicide distribution rates. It provides some key metrics on suicides_per_100K and suicides per capita. Jane wants to determine if 'GDP_per_capita' has any influence on the number of suicides in the population. This particular metric could lead her into details of whether economic and social aspects can affect the suicide rates of each country. Jane definitely needs more metrics to arrive at a decision for certain. She can also draw some relation between the Human Density Index (HDI) and population to work on suicides per 100K. Jane currently has a hypothesis that higher GDP has a positive correlation with the absolute number of suicides and she feels there is more to be analyzed with other parameters which are not part of the current dataset.

From the EDA Jane realised there was one more pattern, ie. there is a larger number of suicides associated with men as compared to women. This made her wonder about the age old question: Are women mentally stable than men? From the observations in the EDA Jane saw that the number of suicides per 100k populations or the number of suicides in general remains high for men as compared to women irrespective of all the generations taken into the study.  However she was reluctant to come to a conclusion about this with just the data and graphs that we have on hand. From the EDA its seen that most suicides were seen among the GI generation - which is the generation which lived through and survived the Great War. She was easily about to research and understand the reason behind this as this generation had to face the neuclear wars and great depression, anyone who survived through these tragic times may have a traumas and panic attacks from what they have seen and faced which may have led them to taking these drastic decisions. And in general the pressure related to war is more faced my men as compared to women and this can slightly explain the reason of suicides in that generation which is then followed by the silent generation which had to endure the repurcussions of the war and again bringing food to the table was a larger stress for men as comared to women. She was however worried that this trend still continues in the following generations too and cannot find much to explain this issue. Hence she decided to take this as a general research question to understand if the above claim is true with more data like the work men and women do the psycological stress they face etc.

#### DESCRIPTION OF YOUR APP AND SKETCH

[![Sample Dash](C:/Users/mural/MDS/BLOCK5/DATA551/dashboard-project-data551_g5/dash_551.png)]

The dashboard is split into 5 parts the first part having the world map highlighted with the countries we have in our dataset. Below the map we have 4 graphs each highlighting different issues that have changed over the years. The values in these graphs will be first displayed for all the countries present in our study. The map is made interactive to choose a country or a set of countries and all the four graphs below will have their values updated in accordance to your selection. Further more we have a side panel where we have the option of zooming in your graphs with the help of the slider if you want to view your data for a particular range of years. The side panel also have radio points for selecting several categorical variables like sex and generation, which when selected will update the graphs required  and give us the variations for that chosen sex or generation.
