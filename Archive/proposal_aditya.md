The dataset is compiled from four other datasets linked by year and country and aims to understand suicide rates for 101 countries across various socio-economic regions between 1986 to 2016. The dataset contains several variables of which Country, Year, Sex, Age, Population, the number of suicides, the proportion of suicides per 100k, Human Development Index (HDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year, GDP per capita and generation were deemed essential for the analysis. Columns `country`, `year`, `sex`, `age` and `generation` were considered to be categorical, with others being continuous. To form an analysis, indexes must be carefully understood to prevent any misinformation. For instance, the Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index measuring average achievement in critical dimensions of human development: standard of living, long and healthy life and knowledge. These dimensions are then normalised and aggregated using the geometric mean. It must be noted that HDI captures only a part of human development and often fails to reflect on inequalities that might be prevalent in society. This suggests that HDI alone might not be a good measure to understand the dynamics of suicide and was thus used in conjunction with GDP per capita to paint a clearer picture.
