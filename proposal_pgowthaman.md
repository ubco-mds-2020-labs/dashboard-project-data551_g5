The purpose of this section is to get you to think about how your target audience might use the app you’re to designing and to account for those needs in the proposal. 
For this it can be helpful to create a brief persona description of a member in your intended target audience and write small user story for what they might do with your app. User stories are typically written in a narrative style and include the specific context of usage, tasks associated with that use context, and a hypothetical walkthrough of how the user would accomplish those tasks with your app. If you are using a Kaggle dataset, you may use their “Overview (inspiration)” to create your usage scenario. 
An example usage scenario with tasks (tasks are indicated in brackets, i.e. [task], and are optional to include) 
Mary is a policy maker with the Canadian Ministry of Health and she wants to understand what factors lead to missed appointments in order to devise an intervention that improves attendance numbers. She wants to be able to [explore] a dataset in order to [compare] the effect of different variables on absenteeism and [identify] the most relevant variables around which to frame her intervention policy. When Mary logs on to the “Missed Appointments app”, she will see an overview of all the available variables in her dataset, according to the number of people that did or did not show up to their medical appointment. She can filter out variables for head-to-head comparisons, and/or rank patients according to their predicted probability of missing an appointment. When she does so, Mary may notice that “physical disability” appears to be a strong predictor missing appointments, and in fact patients with a physical disability also have the largest number of missed appointments. She hypothesizes that patients with a physical disability could be having a hard time finding transportation to their appointments, and decides she needs to conduct a follow-on study since transportation information is not captured in her current dataset. 
Note that in the above example, “physical disability” being an important variable is fictional. You don’t need to conduct an analysis of your data to figure out what is important or not. Instead, estimate what someone might find, and how they may use this information. 
 
### USAGE SCENARIO 
 
A new team in the firm has been asked to put together some statistics on suicide rates for the past few decades to compile a report for public awareness on suicides and suicide attempts. The report aims to make suicide prevention on high priority on the global public health and also to encourage countries around the world to develop comprehensive suicide prevention strategies. Jane is a junior Data Analyst who recently graduated and loves to derive insights from information presented. She wishes to compile a detailed report based on mnay facts. She has been asked to look into the dataset- "Suicide Rates overview 1986-2016". Jane has read the [description] of the dataset and she wants to [explore] and [analyze] the dataset to get some initial sense of some insights about the data. Jane has some initial [EDA] done on the data. When Jane accesses the app "Suicides : A global imperative". The app provides a world-wide suicide distribution rates. It provides some key metrics on suicides_per_100K and suicides per capita. Jane wants to determine if 'GDP_per_capita' has any influence on the number of suicides in the population. This particular metric could lead her into details of whether economic and social aspects can affect the suicide rates of each country. Jane definitely needs more metrics to arrive at a decision for certain. She can also draw some relation between the Human Density Index (HDI) and population to work on suicides per 100K. Jane currently has a hypothesis that higher GDP has a positive correlation with the absolute number of suicides and she feels there is more to be analyzed with other parameters which are not part of the current dataset.
