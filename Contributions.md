# How to Contribute

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome! If you notice a bug or have a feature request, please open up an [issue](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/dashboard-project-data551_g5/issues). All contributors must abide by our code of conduct.

### Submitting the Changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.

Thanks, 
Aditya Saluja, Yatin Behl, Sowmya Chenthi Kumar, Poojitha Gowthaman
