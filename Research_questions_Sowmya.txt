Research questions:

1) Are women mentally stable than men? 
From the observations in the EDA we can see that the number of suicides per 100 populations or the number of suicides in general remains high for men as compared to women irrespective of all the generations taken into the study. We are also well aware of the saying "Men are physically strong and Women are mentally strong". However we cannot cannot come to a conclusion from the sole data that we had on hand about this. We see that the most suicides were seen among the GI generation - which is the generation which lived through and survived the Great War. And we can clearly understand the reason behind this as this generation had to face the neuclear wars and great depression, anyone who survived through these tragic times may have a traumas and panic attacks from what they have seen and faced which may have led them to taking these drastic situations. And in general the pressure related to war is more faced my men as compared to women and this can slightly explain the reason of suicides in that generation which is then followed by the silent generation which had to endure the repurcussions of the war and again bringing food to the table was a larger stress for men as comared to women. Hence but however the trend continues in the following generation too and this is cannot be explained. Hence we can take this as a general research question to understand if the above claim is true. We would need more data like the work men and women do, their responsibilities etc to understand this further.
